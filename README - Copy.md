# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game of strategy and luck that has been around for centuries. This version of the game has been built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows two players to compete against each other in a game of noughts and crosses.

The game board consists of nine tiles arranged in a 3x3 grid. The first player (X) gets to choose a tile and the second player (O) then follows. The players take turns placing their respective markers on the board until one of them has three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine tiles are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

To start playing, simply open the game in your browser and click on a tile to start the game. The game will then alternate turns between players until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

Good luck, and have fun playing this classic game of strategy and luck!
